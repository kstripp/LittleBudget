DESCRIPTION
===========

lb, The Little Budgeting Tool for GnuCash is a command-line utility
that compares a comma-separated values budget definition with a HTML
cash-flow report from GnuCash.  It merges the two documents into a
report that shows (for each account) the budgeted amount, the actual
amount spent, and the difference between the two.

INTRODUCTION
============

GnuCash (www.gnucash.org) is an excellent, high quality financial
application put out by Gnu as part of the Gnome desktop project.
While it is well-written and has many excellent features, on feature
that it does not have is budgeting tools.  While such an interface is
in the works among the developers, I needed something to get me by for
now.  The Little Budgeting Tool meets this need for me.

Budgeting is really pretty simple:

1. You make a plan about how you will spend your money.
2. You compare your actual expenses with your plan to make sure that
you're sticking to your plan.
3. You make adjustments to fit your expenses into your budget, and you
adjust future budgets to be more realistic.

The Little Budgeting Tool for GnuCash is a command-line application
that compares a GnuCash cash-flow report (where you spent your money)
with another text file where you keep your budget.  It outputs a table
to the standard output (your screen) that shows you budgeted values,
actual values, and the difference.
